- 👋 Hi, I’m Jessica "Jessi" Pool @JessiPool. I have a PhD in political science from the University of Cincinnati with a concentration in public opinion and survey research. I currently work in the private sector.
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning into a career in data science. It's a way to get back to my roots, but in a different, modern way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python, and Power BI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and ideas that will improve my skill set, and help others as well.
- 📫 How to reach me - find me here at GitHub, or reach out on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicajohnsonpool/.
